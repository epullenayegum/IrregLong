</h3>
<p>Longitudinal data often has follow-up times that are irregular and
potentially related to outcomes. For example, in a clinic-based cohort
study where all follow-up is part of usual care, patients may visit more
often when unwell. This risks over-estimating the burden of disease
unless data are analysed appropriately. For example, in a study of HIV
positive mothers, Buzkova et al <span class="citation">Buzkova, Brown,
and John-Stewart (2010)</span> found a two-fold over-estimation of the
estimated prevalence of pneumonia when analysis ignored the fact that
women were more likely to visit between scheduled visits when they were
unwell.</p>
<p>There are two categories of methods available for analysing this type
of data: methods based on inverse-intensity weighting, and methods based
on semi-parametric joint models (see <span class="citation">Pullenayegum
and Lim (2016)</span> for an overview). This package provides methods
for inverse-intensity weighting.</p>
<p>Inverse-intensity weighting weights data by the reciprocal of the
intensity (or, equivalently, the hazard) of the visit process.
Inverse-intensity weighting works in a similar way to survey weighting:
observations with a higher intensity are over-represented in the data,
and hence should receive less weight. Conversely, observations with
lower intensity are under-represented in the data, and hence receive
more weight. <span class="citation">Lin, Scharfstein, and Rosenheck
(2004)</span> show that inverse-intensity weighting followed by a
marginal analysis with a generalized estimating equation (GEE) results
in unbiased estimation, subject to the assumptions set out below. This
package contains functions to compute inverse-intensity weights, and
also to fit inverse-intensity weighted GEEs.</p>
<p>Sometimes inference may be desired for a model for which weighting is
not straightforward, for example a generalized linear mixed model or a
latent class mixed model. In these cases, multiple outputation is a
useful alternative to inverse-intensity weighting.</p>
<p>Multiple outputation works by discarding (outputting) excess data
<span class="citation">(Hoffman, Sen, and Weinberg 2001; Follmann,
Proschan, and Leifer 2003)</span>. Visits are randomly deleted from the
dataset with probability inversely proportional to the visit intensity
<span class="citation">(Pullenayegum 2016)</span>. The resulting thinned
visit process is independent of the outcome process (subject to the
assumptions below), and can hence be analysed using standard methods. To
avoid wasting data, the random deletion is repeated multiple times and
the results from each analysis combined. Conceptually, multiple
outputation is the opposite of multiple imputation: where multiple
imputation imputes missing observations multiple times, multiple
outputation discards excess observations multiple times. This package
contains functions to create outputted datasets, as well as to combine
results across multiple outputations.</p>

</h3>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(t)\)</span> is the outcome of
interest for subject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> at time
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(X_i(t)\)</span> be a possibly time-dependent
covariate, and suppose interest is in the marginal model <span class="math display">\[E(Y_i(t)|X_i(t))=X_i(t)\beta.\]</span> Moreover,
suppose that we observe <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> only at
times <span class="math inline">\(T_{i1},T_{i2},\ldots,
T_{in_i}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(N_i(t)\)</span> be
the counting process for the visit times, that is <span class="math inline">\(N_i(t)=\sum_{j}I(T_{ij}\leq t)\)</span>, where
<span class="math inline">\(I()\)</span> is an indicator function.
Suppose moreover that there is a vector of observed covariates <span class="math inline">\(Z_i(t)\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\lim_{\delta \downarrow 0}
\frac{E(N(t)-N(t-\delta))|Y_i(t),Z_i(t))}{\delta}=\frac{E(N(t)-N(t-\delta))|Z_i(t))}{\delta}=\lambda(t;Z_i(t))\]</span>
for some hazard function <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.
If this assumption is not met, alternative methods of analysis should be
considered (e.g. semi-parametric joint models).</p>
<p>The usual GEE equations will result in biased estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> since <span class="math display">\[E(\sum_i\int_0^\tau X_i^\prime (Y_i(t) -
X_i(t)\beta)dN_i(t)) =E(\sum_i\int_0^\tau X_i^\prime E((Y_i(t) -
X_i(t)\beta)dN_i(t)\mid X_i(t)) \neq 0  \]</span> Provided that the
conditional independence assumption holds, consistent estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> may be obtained by weighting the
GEE equations by <span class="math inline">\(sw_i(t)=s_0(t)/\lambda_i(t)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[E(\sum_i\int_0^\tau X_i^\prime sw_i(t)(Y_i(t) -
X_i(t)\beta)dN_i(t)) =E(\sum_i\int_0^\tau X_i^\prime E(sw_i(t)(Y_i(t) -
X_i(t)\beta)dN_i(t)\mid X_i(t),Y_i(t)) \\
= E(\sum_i\int_0^\tau X_i^\prime sw_i(t)(Y_i(t) -
X_i(t)\beta)\lambda_i(t)dt=0.  \]</span></p>

<h3 id="implementing-inverse-intensity-weighting">Implementing Inverse-Intensity weighting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#implementing-inverse-intensity-weighting"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first step in inverse-intensity weighting is to calculate the
weights, usually by fitting a proportional hazards model to the
recurrent event process formed by the visit times. That is, one fits the
model <span class="math display">\[\lambda(t;Z_i(t))=\lambda_0(t)\exp(Z_i(t)\gamma).\]</span>
This can be done using the coxph function, however the data usually
requires some pre-processing. Firstly, the counting process formulation
takes the form Surv(start.time,stop.time,event) and so typically
requires the time variable to be lagged. Time-varying covariates will
often need to be lagged as well. Secondly, if follow-up was stopped at a
time later than the last visit, then additional rows capturing the
censoring time must be added to the dataset. For example, if follow-up
is stopped after two years, and an individual’s last visit is at 1.5
years, then we must include the information that there was no visit
between 1.5 years and two years when estimating the visit intensity
model. Using the data on just the observed visits ignores this.</p>
<p>The IrregLong package simplifies modelling of the visit process by
creating a dataset with lagged variables (specified using lagvars=) and
time intervals corresponding to censoring times (specified using
maxfu=).</p>
<p>The inverse-intensity weight is <span class="math inline">\(w_i(t) =
\frac{\exp(-Z_i(t)\gamma)}{\lambda_0(t)}\)</span>. Following <span class="citation">Buzkova and Lumley (2007)</span>, all inverse-intensity
weights in this package are stabilized by the baseline hazard <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_0(t)\)</span>, so that the stabilized
weight is <span class="math inline">\(sw_i(t)=\exp(-Z_i(t)\gamma)\)</span>. In some
settings one may additionally wish to stabilize by a function of the
time-invariant covariates in <span class="math inline">\(X_i(t)\)</span>, and an option to do so is
included in the functions. One can then fit a GEE to obtain the
regression coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
corresponding to regressing <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(t)\)</span>
on <span class="math inline">\(X_i(t)\)</span>, weighting by <span class="math inline">\(sw_i(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>An important practical point is that when using inverse-intensity
weighting the working variance for the GEE must be set to the identity.
This is because functions for fitting GEEs interpret the weights as
indicating heteroscedasticity. Thus if <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> is the vector of observations for
subject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is the matrix of corresponding
covariates, <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> is the working
variance matrix and <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> is a
diagonal matrix whose <span class="math inline">\(jj\)</span> entry of
the weight for the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span>
observation for subject <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then
standard GEE software solves <span class="math display">\[\sum_iX_i^\prime
D_i^{1/2}R_i^{-1}D_i^{1/2}(Y_i-X_i\beta)=0,\]</span> whereas we wish to
solve <span class="math display">\[\sum_iX_i^\prime
R_i^{-1}D_i(Y_i-X_i\beta)=0.\]</span> The two are, however, identical if
<span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> is the identity matrix. While
at first glance it may seem appealing to create a GEE estimation
function that implements the weights as desired so as to allow for
non-diagonal working variance matrices, note that the working variance
should then be the variance of <span class="math inline">\(D_i(Y_i-X_i\beta)\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\((Y_i-X_i\beta)\)</span>. Since the weights usually
involve time-dependent covariates that are often internal, the standard
correlation structures (exchangeable, autoregressive) become less
plausible.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example"></a>
</h4>
<p>These methods are illustrated using the Phenobarb dataset from the
MEMSS package. Routine clinical pharmacokinetic data were collected from
59 preterm infants who received phenobarbital in order to prevent
seizures. Blood draws were taken to determine serum concentration of
phenobarbital, with the timing and number of draws varying among
infants. For the purposes of illustration this analysis focuses not on
pharmacokinetics but on the mean serum concentration of phenobarbital
over time.</p>
<p>This dataset contains some rows corresponding to times at which
phenobarbital given and others at which a blood draw was taken to
determine serum phenobarbital concentration. For the visit intensity
model, the event of interest is having a concentration measured, so we
set the variable event=1 if concentration was measured and zero
otherwise. The data is then restricted to those time points when a
concentration measurement was taken. The original pharmacokinetic
analysis restricts attention to the first 16 days of life, which we also
do here.</p>

<p>It can be helpful to begin by exploring the extent of visit
irregularity. We begin with some simple summary statistics of the number
of events per Subject, then plot times of measurement for each
subjects.</p>

<p>This shows an median of 3 visits per subject with a range of 1 to 6.
The plot shows that after an initial measurement shortly after birth,
observations times vary among subjects.</p>
<p>The extent of irregularity can be further explored through a visit
frequency plot. This plot is derived by dividing the time interval of
interest into sets of bins with bin widths becoming increasingly wider
across sets. For each set of bins, the mean proportion of individuals
with 0, 1 or &gt;1 visit per bin is calculated. This is then plotted
against either the number of bins or some other measure of bin width.
When the study protocol does not specify recommended visit times, sets
of bins can be defined either as intervals of equal widths (with
different numbers of bins in each set), or as intervals for which the
expected number of visits per bin is constant across bins (again, with
varying numbers of bins in each set). The expected number of visits in a
bin is simply the area under the cumulative hazard for that bin. The
visit frequency plot shows that the mean proportion of individuals with
1 visit per bin is highest at 0.5 with 3 bins, and is clearly not
consistent with repeated measures. Finally, the area under the curve
(AUC) when the proportion of subjects with <span class="math inline">\(&gt;1\)</span> visits per bin is plotted against
the proportion of subjects with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>
visits per bin can be used as a numeric summary of the extent of
irregularity. For perfect repeated measures, the AUC is 0; for a Poisson
process, the AUC is 0.25. A log transformed version of the AUC is also
available; for this version perfect repeated measures has a value of
zero while a Poisson process has an AUC of 100. The AUC in this example
is 0.18, with a transformed value of 64, demonstrating a high degree of
irregularity.</p>

<p>To fit an inverse intensity weighted GEE, one begins by modelling the
visit intensity. Although the IrregLong package includes a function that
calculates both the inverse-intensity weights and the weighted GEE in a
single command, it can be helpful to start by focussing on the visit
intensity model. Modelling is usually done through a Cox proportional
hazards model on the recurrent visit process. To do this, we need to
specify time periods at risk, and so need to lag the time variable. If
there are time-dependent covariates and we suspect that the value at the
last measurement is predictive of when the next measurement will be
taken, these time-dependent covariates must also be lagged. The
IrregLong package simplifies this process by allowing the user to
specify which covariates should be lagged (lagvars=c(“time”,“conc”)) and
creating these lagged covariates internally (time.lag,conc.lag). The
value of the lagged variables will by default be missing for the first
observation in each subject, but this can be changed through the
lagfirst argument. We set the lagged value of time at the first observed
blood draw to be zero (lagfirst=0) since observation started at birth
for all infants. Similarly, we set the lagged value of serum
phenobarbital concentration to be zero at the first draw, since the last
known value of serum concentration was at birth, prior to administration
of phenobarbital, and allow for a non-linear relationship between
concentration and log visit intensity.</p>

whether the model can be simplified - first by including Apgar score as
an indicator (<span class="math inline">\(\geq 5\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(&lt;5\)</span>), then by removing variables that

<p>It thus appears that last concentration is predictive of the time to
the next concentration measurement.</p>
<p>Having established a model for the visit intensity, we now turn to
modelling the serum concentration as a function of time. A plot of
concentration over time shows that the relationship is unlikely to be
linear, even in the weighted data. We thus use fractional polynomials to
model the shape of the association over time.</p>

<p>Fractional polynomials consider powers of -2, -1, -0.5, 0.5, 1, 2, 3,
and a log-transform, and use the best-fitting from among these. Since
weighting tends not to lead to dramatic changes in the shape of the
relationship between outcome and covariates, we use the unweighted data
to choose the functional form of time, and use the adjusted R-squared as
a measure of goodness of fit.</p>

<p>Once the inverse-intensity weights have been calculated, an
alternative use for them is to perform multiple outputation. When some
of the weights are very large, this can result in very small outputted
datasets, and so it can be helpful to truncate the weights. Moreover,
the smaller sample size of each outputted dataset results in
collinearity on including all three functions of time, so for this
analysis we use time and time^3 only, as these were the best fit in the
weighted data. The code below computes 20 outputted datasets, analyses
each using an unweighted GEE, then combines the results.</p>

<p>The multiple outputation estimates of the regression coefficients
(<code>$est</code>), and is the mean across outputations of the GEE
estimates. The multiple outputation standard error (<code>$se</code>) is
a function of both the within outputation standard errors and the
between outputation variance. The relative efficiency of using 20
outputations in place of all possible outputations is given by
<code>RE.MO</code>. In this example the number of observations per
subject becomes small on outputation, resulting in the usual sandwich
variance estimator for the GEE underestimating the standard error. For
this reason, we use a small sample sandwich variance correction from the
“geesmv” package. There are a number of options available, and in this
example we have used the Mancl deRouen correction <span class="citation">(Mancl and DeRouen 2001)</span>. The multiple
outputation estimates based on the above seed were 16.0 (SE 1.53),
-7.72e-07 (SE 1.16e-07) and 3.42 (SE 5.52) for the intercept, <span class="math inline">\(time\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(time^3\)</span> respectively. The relative
efficiencies were 1.01, 1.008, and 1.008, suggesting that there is
little to be gained by running more outputations.</p>
<p>Multiple outputation is helpful for analyses where weighting is
difficult to implement. One such example is a semi-parametric joint
model. Semi-parametric joint models are useful when there are latent
variables that influence both the outcome and visit processes. We
consider the Liang <span class="citation">(Liang, Lu, and Ying
2009)</span> semi-parametric joint model: <span class="math display">\[Y_i(t)=\beta_0(t) + X_i(t)\beta + W_i(t)\nu_{i1}
+ \epsilon_i(t) \]</span> <span class="math display">\[\lambda_i(t)=\nu_{i2}\lambda_0(t)\exp(U_i\gamma)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(W_i(t)\)</span> is a subset
of the covariates <span class="math inline">\(X_i(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> is a vector of baseline covariates,
<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i(t)\)</span> is a mean-zero random
error, and <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{i1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{i2}\)</span> are (potentially correlated)
random effects.</p>
<p>The Liang model requires that the covariates in the model for the
visits be time invariant. In practice, <span class="math display">\[\lambda_i(t)=\nu_{i2}\lambda_0(t)\exp(Z_i(t)\gamma),
\]</span> for an observed vector of time-dependent auxiliary covariates
<span class="math inline">\(Z_i(t)\)</span> may be more reasonable.
Multiple outputation makes inference under this model possible by
creating outputted datasets in which the visit process does not depend
on the observed covariates <span class="math inline">\(Z_i(t)\)</span>.
These datasets can be analysed using Liang’s method for the special case
where there are no covariates in the visit process model.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="example-1">Example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-1"></a>
</h4>
<p>We consider the same example as before, now examining whether the
concentration differs between those with an Apgar score &lt;5 at birth
and those with a score &gt;=5, and allowing a random intercept that is
potentially correlated with a frailty variable in the visit process.
That is, we take <span class="math display">\[conc_i(t)=\beta_0(t) +
\beta_1I(Apgar_i&lt;5) + \beta_2I(Apgar\geq 5)t + \beta_3I(Apgar\geq
5)t^3 +  \nu_{i1} + \epsilon_i(t),\]</span> with visit process model
given by <span class="math display">\[\lambda_i(t)=\nu_{i2}\lambda_0(t)\exp(I(0&lt;conc_i(T_{iN_i(t^-)})\leq
20)\gamma_1 + I(20&lt; conc_i(T_{iN_i(t^-)})\leq 30)\gamma_2 +\\
I(conc_i(T_{iN_i(t^-)})&gt; 30)\gamma_3, \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{i1}=(\nu_{i11},\nu_{i12})^\prime\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\nu_{i2}\)</span> are potentially correlated
with <span class="math inline">\(E(\nu_{i1}\mid\nu_{i2})=\theta(\nu_{i2}-1)\)</span>
for some <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Note that when
calculating the weights used for outputation, the
<code>frailty=TRUE</code> option should be used in visit intensity
calculation because the lagged concentration is an internal covariate
that is potentially correlated with the frailty variable, and the Cox
model is non-collapsible. For this analysis, time is transformed to days
rather than hours to avoid computational problems with the Liang
function.</p>
