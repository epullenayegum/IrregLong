\title{Create an outputted dataset for use with multiple outputation.}
\usage{
outputation(data, weights, singleobs, id, time, keep.first)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the original dataset on which multiple outputation is to be performed}

\item{weights}{the weights to be used in the outputation, i.e. the inverse of the probability that a given observation will be selected in creating an outputted dataset. Ignored if singleobs=TRUE}

\item{singleobs}{logical variable indicating whether a single observation should be retained for each subject}

\item{id}{character string indicating which column of the data identifies subjects}

\item{time}{character string indicating which column of the data contains the time at which the visit occurred}

\item{keep.first}{logical variable indicating whether the first observation should be retained with probability 1. This is useful if the data consists of an observation at baseline followed by follow-up at stochastic time points.}
}
\value{
the outputted dataset.
}
\description{
Multiple outputation is a procedure whereby excess observations are repeatedly randomly sampled and discarded. The method was originally developed to handle clustered data where cluster size is informative, for example when studying pups in a litter. In this case, analysis that ignores cluster size results in larger litters being over-represented in a marginal analysis. Multiple outputation circumvents this problem by randomly selecting one observation per cluster. Multiple outputation has been further adapted to handle longitudinal data subject to irregular observation; here the probability of being retained on any given outputation is inversely proportional to the visit intensity. This function creates a single outputted dataset.

# Note that the outputted dataset varies with each command run; outputation is done at random
